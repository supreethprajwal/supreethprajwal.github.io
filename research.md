Digital sensors in smartphones and wearables measure huge quantities of data, such as heart rate (HR) and accelerometry time series.

However, simple metrics such as resting HR and total step count do not describe structure, complexity, or how information varies with time scale or transfers between different signals.

In my PhD I used machine learning, statistics, and information theory to show classification of illness using features from HR and activity time series is improved by considering information over several time scales and between signals.

My advisor was [Gari Clifford, DPhil](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari). We patented some of our work and [licensed it to a medical technology company](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/medibio-s-noninvasive-objective-ptsd-diagnostic-correct-80-time).

I also published papers on medical education, neuro-oncology, plastic surgery, and biomaterials.
